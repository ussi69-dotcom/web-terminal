# DeckTerm Operations Guide

## Purpose

This document describes the current operational model of DeckTerm as it exists today.

It covers:

- repository branches
- local server checkouts
- systemd services
- GitHub Actions
- release layout
- deployment and rollback

## Branch and Environment Model

Git model:

- `feature/*` for isolated work
- `dev` for integration
- `main` for production

Runtime model:

- `4174` is development
- `4173` is production

## Server Layout

### Development runtime

- checkout: [`/home/deploy/deckterm_dev`](/home/deploy/deckterm_dev)
- branch: `dev`
- service: `deckterm-dev.service`

### Production runtime

Production is deployed into release directories and served through a stable symlink:

```text
/home/deploy/apps/deckterm/
├── incoming/
├── prod/
│   ├── current -> /home/deploy/apps/deckterm/prod/releases/<sha>
│   ├── previous -> /home/deploy/apps/deckterm/prod/releases/<sha>
│   ├── releases/
│   └── shared/
└── shared/
    └── prod.env
```

The production service reads:

- code from `prod/current`
- environment from `/home/deploy/apps/deckterm/shared/prod.env`

The legacy checkout [`/home/deploy/deckterm`](/home/deploy/deckterm) is not the production runtime source anymore.

## Systemd Services

### Production

Service file: [`/home/deploy/.config/systemd/user/deckterm.service`](/home/deploy/.config/systemd/user/deckterm.service)

Key properties:

- user-level systemd
- working directory is the `current` release symlink
- explicit Bun path in `ExecStart`
- `TMUX_BACKEND=1`

### Development

Service file: `deckterm-dev.service`

Key properties:

- runs from [`/home/deploy/deckterm_dev`](/home/deploy/deckterm_dev)
- used for all active browser testing on `4174`

## GitHub Actions

### CI

Workflow: [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](/home/deploy/deckterm_dev/.github/workflows/ci.yml)

Runs on:

- pushes to `main`, `dev`, `feature/**`, `fix/**`, `chore/**`
- PRs to `main` and `dev`

Jobs:

- `unit`
- `smoke-e2e`

### Deploy Main

Workflow: [`.github/workflows/deploy-main.yml`](/home/deploy/deckterm_dev/.github/workflows/deploy-main.yml)

Behavior:

1. verify-and-package
   - install dependencies
   - run unit tests
   - start DeckTerm on `4174`
   - run smoke E2E
   - build release tarball
2. deploy
   - gated by `ENABLE_PROD_DEPLOY=1`
   - downloads artifact
   - copies it over SSH
   - expands to incoming release directory
   - runs deploy script on the server

### Promote Dev To Main

Workflow: [`.github/workflows/promote-dev-to-main.yml`](/home/deploy/deckterm_dev/.github/workflows/promote-dev-to-main.yml)

Behavior:

- creates or updates a promotion PR from `dev` to `main`
- can optionally enable auto-merge

## GitHub Configuration

### Secrets

- `DEPLOY_HOST`
- `DEPLOY_USER`
- `DEPLOY_SSH_KEY`

### Variables

- `ENABLE_PROD_DEPLOY=1`
- `DEPLOY_PORT`
- `DEPLOY_ROOT`
- `PROD_PORT`
- `PROD_CANDIDATE_PORT`
- `PROD_SERVICE`

### Branch protections

Recommended and currently used model:

- `dev`
  - PR required
  - `unit` and `smoke-e2e` required
- `main`
  - PR required
  - `unit` and `smoke-e2e` required
  - one approval required

## Deployment Script Behavior

Primary script: [scripts/deploy_release.sh](/home/deploy/deckterm_dev/scripts/deploy_release.sh)

Current deployment flow:

1. copy unpacked source into a versioned release directory
2. symlink shared env file and write a `RELEASE_ID` marker into the release
3. install dependencies inside the release
4. refuse to deploy if `PROD_CANDIDATE_PORT` is already in use (stale candidate)
5. start a candidate instance on `PROD_CANDIDATE_PORT`
6. wait for candidate health, then confirm the candidate process is still alive
7. repoint `current` symlink
8. restart production systemd service
9. verify live health on `PROD_PORT`
10. verify `/api/health` reports the release id just promoted (proof prod is
    actually serving this build, not a rolled-back/stale one)
11. rollback to `previous` and exit non-zero on any failure

Important hardening already in place:

- startup failures exit non-zero instead of leaving a fake alive process
- SSH deploy key is written with trailing newline
- deploy script uses an explicit Bun path for non-interactive SSH shells
- candidates are killed as a whole process tree (`kill_tree`) so the real
  server child does not leak onto the candidate port after each deploy
- the candidate port is checked free before starting, and the candidate PID is
  re-checked alive after the health probe, so "something healthy on the port"
  can no longer be mistaken for "the new build is healthy"
- promotion is verified end to end via the `release` field of `/api/health`;
  a silent rollback can no longer be reported as a successful deploy
- the remote deploy script runs under an explicit non-interactive `bash` so a
  failing/rolled-back deploy propagates its exit code and fails the job

## Rollback

Rollback script: [scripts/rollback_release.sh](/home/deploy/deckterm_dev/scripts/rollback_release.sh)

Example:

```bash
DEPLOY_ROOT=/home/deploy/apps/deckterm/prod \
SYSTEMD_SERVICE=deckterm.service \
bash scripts/rollback_release.sh
```

## Validation Commands

### Local development validation

```bash
bun run test:unit
bun run test:e2e:smoke
bun run test:e2e:workspace
```

### Service health

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:4174/api/health
curl http://127.0.0.1:4173/api/health
systemctl --user status deckterm-dev.service
systemctl --user status deckterm.service
```

`/api/health` returns a `release` field: the deployed release id (commit SHA) in
production, or `"dev"` for a local checkout. To confirm prod is serving the
expected build without trusting the CI badge:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:4173/api/health | grep -o '"release":"[^"]*"'
readlink /home/deploy/apps/deckterm/prod/current   # should end in the same SHA
```

## Known Operational Notes

- Production now deploys cleanly from `main` via GitHub Actions
- `deckterm.service` is the production service name
- browser tests target `4174`
- stale local git checkouts can exist without affecting runtime because production runs from release directories
- **A green `Deploy Main` run now means prod is actually serving the new build.**
  The deploy verifies `/api/health` reports the promoted release id and fails
  (with automatic rollback) otherwise. Before this guarantee was added, a deploy
  could silently roll back while the job stayed green.
- History (2026-05): prod was stuck ~17 days on an old build because `bun run
start` leaked its server child onto the candidate port; that stale process
  answered the candidate health probe, so every deploy "passed" the gate, then
  failed live promotion and rolled back behind a green badge. Fixed by killing
  the candidate process tree, gating on a free candidate port, and verifying the
  served release id. If a deploy ever fails with "Candidate port ... already in
  use", a candidate leaked — `kill` the PID on `PROD_CANDIDATE_PORT` (it is not
  the live server, which is on `PROD_PORT`).

## Recommended Team Workflow

1. Work in `feature/*` or directly on `dev`
2. Validate behavior on `4174`
3. Merge to `dev`
4. Promote `dev` to `main`
5. Let `Deploy Main` verify and deploy automatically

## Security and Multiuser Isolation Model

### Multiuser Permissions

DeckTerm enforces multiuser boundaries at the **application level**:

- Each terminal session (`terminal_sessions`) is owned by a specific user identity resolved via Cloudflare Access (`sub`).
- Attaching to a terminal session requires owner status or a matching `terminal.attach` scoped grant.
- Writing to a terminal session (sending input) requires owner status or a matching `terminal.write` scoped grant.

### OS-Level Isolation Disclaimer

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTICE:** DeckTerm's multiuser permissions isolate access within the application layer. However, under the hood, all terminal processes and tmux sessions are executed by the **same Unix user** (e.g. `deploy`) running the Bun/Hono server.
>
> Therefore, DeckTerm **does not provide OS-level containerization or process/file sandbox isolation** between different users' sessions. Any user with interactive shell access (`terminal.write`) can inspect other processes or access files owned by this Unix account. For multi-tenant hosting with strong security boundaries, you must use separate container/VM deployments or different OS-level Unix accounts.
